So things look bad, and your back's against the wall
Your whole existence seems fuckin' hopeless
You're feelin' filthy as a dive bar bathroom stall
Can't face the world sober and dopeless
You've lost your way, you think your life is wrecked
Well, let me just say you're correct

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Wait, what?

[HUSK]
You're a loser, baby
A loser, goddamn baby
You're a fucked-up little whiny bitch

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Hey!

[HUSK]
You're a loser, just like me

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Thanks, asshole

[HUSK]
You're a screws-loose boozer
An only one-star reviews-er
You're a power-bottom at rock bottom
But you got company


[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
This supposed to make me feel better?

[HUSK]
There was a time I thought that no one could relate
To the gruesome ways in which I'm damaged
But lettin' walls down, it can sometimes set you straight!
We're all livin' in the same shit sandwich

[ANGEL DUST]

[ANGEL DUST]
Coked-up, dick-suckin' ho?

[HUSK]
Baby, that's fine by me!

[ANGEL DUST]
I'm a loser, honey
A schmoozer and a dummy
But at least I know I'm not alone
[HUSK]
You're a loser

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK]
Just like me

[HUSK]
I got an appetite for gamblin'

[ANGEL DUST]
I got an appetite for samplin'
Every drug and sex toy I can find!

[HUSK]
Go ahead baby, sing that song, come on!

[ANGEL DUST]
I got no holes left to deflower

[HUSK]
I sold my soul to save my power
Now I'm on that demon's leash

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK]
I'm trapped and it gets worse with every hour
[ANGEL DUST]
You're a loser, baby

[HUSK]
A loser, but just maybe if we

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK]
Eat shit together, things will end up differently

[HUSK]
It's time to lose your self-loathin'
Excuse yourself, let hope in, baby
Play your card, be who you are

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK]
A loser, just like me
